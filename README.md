# Data Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of data science, data analysis and other relevant projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

- [**Winning Space Race with Data Science**](https://github.com/ikuzuki/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Coursera%20IBM%20Data%20science%20capstone%20presentation.pdf)

  SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 rocket launches can land and reuse their first stage which saves huge costs for each launch. However, sometimes during a test launch, the first stage may not land, this is often intentional and not due to accidents. The aim was to try to predict the launch outcome of SpaceX rockets using publicly available data and without diving into the technical rocket science.

  **Key skills**: Data Collection, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning, SQL, Python

- [**Planning a Succesful Electric Vehicle Release**](https://github.com/ikuzuki/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Experian%20step%20up%20challenge%20-%20Issei%20Kuzuki.pdf)

  BMW are planning to release a new electric vehicle and are looking for potential customers. The aim was to use survey data and google analytics data along with the Mosaic UK 7 Grand Index to form profiles of potential customers for their new product as well as build an algorithm to identify users who may be interested in a test drive.

  **Key skills**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualisation, Building Algorithms, Presentation, Python

- [**Expected Statistics in the Premier League - Can we rely on them?**](https://github.com/ikuzuki/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Expected%20Statistics%20in%20Football%20-%20Tableau%20project.pdf)
  
  [Link to Tableau Public Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/issei.kuzuki/viz/ExpectedstatsintheEPLstory/xEPL?publish=yes)
  
  Expected statistics such as xG and xA are commonly used in football as a metric to analyse matches and player performance. The aim was to investigate the reliability and effectiveness of these statistics since these metrics are crucial for both sports analysts and clubs for player evaluation and tactical decisions.

  **Key skills**: Data Visualisation, Data Storytelling, Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Tableau, Excel

- [**Solving Optimisation Problems**](https://github.com/ikuzuki/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Solving%20optimisation%20problems.pdf)

  Implemented and investigated 2 optimisation algorithms, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm to solve a constrained optimisation problem. The function being optimised was a 6 dimensional Schwefel's function which has multiple local minima and maxima making it a complex problem to solve.

  **Key skills**: Optimisation, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, Python
