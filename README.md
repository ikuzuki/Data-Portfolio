# Data Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of data science and data analysis projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

- [**Winning Space Race with Data Science**](https://github.com/ikuzuki/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Coursera%20IBM%20Data%20science%20capstone%20presentation.pdf)

  SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 rocket launches can land and reuse their first stage which saves huge costs for each launch. However, sometimes during a test launch, the first stage may not land, this is often intentional and not due to accidents. The aim was to try to predict the launch outcome of spaceX rockets using publicly available data and without diving into the technical specifications of the rocket science.

  **Key skills**: Data Collection, Data Wrangling, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning, SQL, Python

- [**Planning a Succesful Electric Vehicle Release**](https://github.com/ikuzuki/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Experian%20step%20up%20challenge%20-%20Issei%20Kuzuki.pdf)

  BMW are planning to release a new electric vehicle and are looking for potential customers. The aim was to use survey data and google analytics data along with the Mosaic UK 7 Grand Index to form profiles of potential customers for their new product as well as build an algorithm to identify users who may be interested in a test drive.

  **Key skills**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualisation, Building Algorithms, Presentation, Python
